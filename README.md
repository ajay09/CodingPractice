My Solutions to Daily Coding Problems from <http://www.dailycodingproblem.com>

***

### Problem 1
Given a list of numbers, return whether any two sums to k. For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.
Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

### Problem 2
This problem was asked by Uber.

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.
For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

Follow-up: what if you can't use division? And in constant space.

### Problem 3
This problem was asked by Google.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
 
 Example:
 

            1           
           / \
          2   3
             / \
            4   5


 as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]"

### Problem 4
This problem was asked by Stripe.
Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space. In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array. The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.
 
For example, the input [3, 4, -1, 1] should give 2. The input [1, 2, 0] should give 3.
